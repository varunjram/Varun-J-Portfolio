            <p>
                Yoga Mudras are specific hand gestures created to facilitate the flow of energy, Prana, in the body, and
                mind for optimal health.<br>

                <br>

                'Mudra' is a Sanskrit word that literally means 'hand gesture'.<br>

                <br>

                Yoga Mudras or hand gestures are also part of Vedic healing practice? Yoga is an ancient practice that
                has been transforming lives for centuries now; we all know Yoga as a science of challenging physical
                poses called 'Asanas' and breathing techniques called ‘Pranayama’
                performed to keep the physical and mental bodies fit.
