            <h2 clas> What is Markdown? </h2>

            <p>Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Created by John Gruber in 2004, Markdown is now one of the world’s most popular markup languages.</p>

            <h2> Why Use Markdown? </h2>

            <p>Why use Markdown instead of a <a class="mdlinks"  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG">WYSIWYG</a> ("What You See Is What You Get"-applications like Microsoft word) editor. Why write with Markdown when you can press buttons in an interface to format your text? As it turns out, there are a couple different reasons why people use Markdown instead of WYSIWYG editors.

                <ul >
                    <li>Markdown can be used for everything. People use it to create websites, documents, notes, books, presentations, email messages, and technical documentation.</li>
    
                    <li>Markdown is portable. Files containing Markdown-formatted text can be opened using virtually any application.In contrast to word processing applications like Microsoft Word that lock your content into a proprietary file format.</li>
    
                    <li> Markdown is platform independent. You can create Markdown-formatted text on any device running any operating system.</li>

                    <li>Markdown is future proof. Even if the application you’re using stops working at some point in the future, you’ll still be able to read your Markdown-formatted text using a text editing application</li>


                    <li>This is an important consideration when it comes to books, university theses, and other milestone documents that need to be preserved indefinitely.</li>


                    <li> Markdown is everywhere. Websites like Reddit and GitHub support Markdown, and lots of desktop and web-based applications support it.</li>

                </ul>
